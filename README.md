# Hi There, I'm Dexter (Tran) Nguyen

<div align="center">ðŸŒ± As an immigrant, I have always harbored the dream of becoming a Software Engineer. Currently, I'm a senior at Cal Poly Pomona pursuing a major in Computer Science. In addition to my academic pursuits, I also have a keen interest in photography and videography, which I enjoy doing in my free time. I am actively seeking a full-time opportunity to leverage my skills and knowledge in the tech industry. With my passion for coding and my creativity in visual storytelling, I believe that I can make a valuable contribution to any team. I am excited about the prospect of taking on new challenges and growing as a professional in this dynamic field.<br><br>
